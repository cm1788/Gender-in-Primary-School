hot water bottle to get warm and put the floorboard back it all right everyone he call you can come out now but nobody move nobody stir nobody want to come out the squirrel be tuck away in the pocket of percy dress gown the hedgehog be in his coat the fox the rabbit the badger and the duck be all safely hide away the mice have even squeeze themselves into percy slipper everyone have find cosy bed well never say percy percy yawn and snuggle down in his own bed once again that well now ve get plenty of room he say and little to spare for mole nin tower forest where summer have be the cool air bit fresh and the moss grow green and as autumn edge in and the sky rage red the sleepy creature get ready for bed while up in tree swing flighty young squirrel who everyone know as spontaneous cyril now most foresty folk have see to their need through the plentiful month of mushroom and seed they build up their store so they all be well feed through the frosting of winter that glitter ahead but cyril he live in the now and the here he adventure and partie his way through the year so his cupboard be empty his hollow be bare he hadn a mouthful of food anywhere but wait what be that over there take look single lone pine cone wedge in nook he squeal with delight and for very good reason for inside be the very last nut of the season but cyril wasn alone there be more hungry eye yes plan ahead bruce have his sight on the prize though he gather mountain of bounty hard fight bruce be convince he be one pine cone short simply must have it he wistfully cry as he dream of the fresh juicy pine nut inside so as cyril set off on his way to the ground bruce he be also last pine cone bind they sprint and scurry with no time to gamble they scratch at the bark in their scamper scramble but their panic and haste shake the tip of the spruce and the pine cone it tremble and then it come loose both squirrel give chase at lighten pace this be the start of wild nutty race it mine shout cyril no mine holler bruce you don stand chance give up it no use m hungry cry cyril this cone be not yours stay back shout bruce this cone for my store it boinge over bush and fly through the air it binge on the nose of slumber bear it bounce over boulder then come to stop then teeter and wobble and quiver and plop both squirrel follow oh the water be fast would they learn that they need each other at last each but be intent on how he could win so they didn quite notice bird sweep in cyril and bruce they watch in dismay as their cone disappear up up up and away come back shout cyril they re our nut exclaim bruce but all hope be go it be simply no use and meanwhile they drift right up to the ledge greed it be drive them over the edge cyril and bruce they have take fall they be pay the price for want it all they squander their chance to team up and share would their nutty young hope simply end in despair bruise and bedraggled they sweep past dry land cyril grab at branch with tremble hand catch bruce with the other he heave and he huff and drag him to safety with panting and puff let out snort how silly we be he proclaim all jiggle how greedy ve be splutter bruce with giggle we shall change from today may the squabbling cease we should celebrate see we re both in one piece from that day and forward they make great pair they would gather together and find they could share yes cyril and bruce they know in the end the good thing to share be laugh with your friend nthis be arthur and this be the truth arthur and the truth be not the good of friend right now because today this happen which cause this and also this the truth be arthur know he do wrong because his mum have tell him he wasn to ride his brother big bike so when his friend noah ask what have happen arthur try bend the truth just little bit this supercool princess ask if she could have go on my brother bike she never ride one before and bash into my mum car she didn even say sorry uh oh bet your mum go to be really cross say noah that wasn exactly what arthur want to hear so when his friend lula ask him what have happen arthur try stretch the truth instead be just have little go on my brother bike when an alien ask if he could borrow it he say he need it to get home think he think it would fly uh oh bet your mum not go to be very pleased sigh lula that wasn exactly what arthur want to hear either arthur decide that more drastic action be need he try cover up the truth disguise it hide it but it refuse to stay cover up or disguise or hide so when little frankie ask arthur what have happen arthur decide just to ignore the truth altogether it have nothing to do with me my brother bike just transform into giant robot and mum car do too there be h uge fight and mum car win cooool say little frankie bet your mum will be pleased about that err hope so say arthur arthur it be mum time for arthur to face the truth he look the truth square in the eye the truth look back arthur do you have something to tell me ask his mum what will arthur do what would you do well arthur say something that surprise even him it be me do it sorry and that turn out to be all right actually although mum wasn too happy about her car and the bike she be pleased that arthur have tell her the truth so what start out as bad day finish up be good day for arthur and now arthur and the truth be the good friend of and arthur never ride his brother big bike again well not anywhere near his mum car i ve lose my mum hush little monkey don you cry will help you find her say butterfly let have think how big be she she big say the monkey big than me big than you then ve see your mum come little monkey come come come no no no that an elephant my mum isn a great grey hunk she hasn get tusk or curly

beautiful finally monkey could see everything include the rest of her troop they look very excited to see me it must be time to go think monkey and she swing down from the tall tree feel very pleased
